This is an assortment of pure Python implementations of some random data structures that I've either felt would be useful to have or just wanted to learn more about.

### Development

- Install dependencies (only needed for testing): `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Testing: `pytest` or `pytest --cov=src` for coverage reports
- Formatting: black
